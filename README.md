A filtering system for Meraki MV camera motion alerts that uses the idea that you don't need alerts for motion if a trusted individual is in the same location where the motion was detected. 


This is being built. Just posting so I can version control at this point. 


This is a seperate program from an earlier proof of this concept I built as a simple python script.
